paul_my apologies irritable subject tone rhetoric quoting paul linehan plinehan yahoo com indeed actually understood prior example commercial entities trial limited crippled editions problem see problem suse though surely merrrier far concerned anything either say motivation speculation bearing disclaimer mind mine make money selling boxed sets glad make versions available almost unrestricted distribution value via cd duplication internet estimate substitute boxed set sales example _could_ packaged call ftp edition images fact suggests see inconvenience mirroring ftp edition files moment motivation really determined buy boxed sets instead likewise _could_ release current version evaluation single disk iso image instead always keep several versions behind seems like incentive buy boxed set evaluating suse via iso image speculation motivations know certainty permissions ve_granted bit messy complex nonetheless quite clear permissions reminder apply suse produced components yast distribution installer program possibly utilities know _they_ wrote code every right grant withhold permissions suit best one suspect one likes understand suse proprietary extensions prepared allow people use gpl even freebsd style licence hmm let slow persistent misconception possible place somebody else work new licence without permission nothing copyright law would make possible copyright
