designed specifically process xml data unlike competing solutions process xml data software datapower device processes data hardware technology achievement provides greater performance according company officials new device dubbed datapower xml accelerator first family products expected cambridge mass based startup datapower family based proprietary processing core technology called analysis parsing processing xml data according steve kelly ceo datapower accelerator conceived meet steady adoption xml anticipated future proliferation web services means share data two businesses vision build xml aware infrastructure kelly said first family kelly explained converting data xml increases file size times said makes processing data taxing application servers datapower believes inline device best alternative addition large file sizes security also paramount importance world xml today firewalls designed inspect http traffic kelly said soap packet xml go straight firewall firewalls blind xml today future products datapowers family focus specifically security especially web services proliferate kelly said according datapower existing solutions offload xml processing homegrown done software approach company tried initially found inadequate regards speed security trying software path company turned creating solution would process xml hardware execution core converts xml machine code said kelly adding knowledge company solution kelly said next months expects market flooded technologies claim xml processing claims believes mostly false content aware switches ssl secure socket layer accelerators load balancers look first bytes packet provides deeper packet inspection looking bytes thus enabling greater processing xml data kelly explained high network device tested large collection xml xsl data types learn new flavors markup language pass device deployed proxy mode behind firewall load balancer inspect traffic passes identify process packets xml kelly said addition proxy mode device also used application co processor deployment method gives administrators granular control data inspected application server controls device datapower company chasing
