turley microprocessor industry analyst going forward mips maintaining good control still haunted incompatibility among multiples biggest risk mips camp fragmentation powerpc camp opposite problem architectural confinement though powerpc architecture carries cachet household names motorola ibm essentially two companies provide powerpcs lack interest rather companies reluctant cede control
