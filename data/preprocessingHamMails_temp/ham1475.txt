satellite average temperature cubic kilometers air msu makes direct measurement temperature looking microwaves emitted oxygen molecules atmosphere intensity microwave emissions brightness varies according temperature christy spencer developed method take data several satellites produce unified temperature dataset verifying accuracy msu measurements recent comparison temperature readings two major climate monitoring systems microwave sounding units satellites thermometers suspended helium balloons found remarkable level agreement two verify accuracy temperature data collected microwave sounding units christy compared temperature readings recorded radiosonde thermometers temperatures reported satellites orbited balloon launch sites found percent correlation year period study overall composite temperature trends sites agreed within degrees celsius fahrenheit per decade results found considering stations polar arctic regions idea determine reliability satellite data comparing established independent measurement christy said satellite data reliable satellites radiosonde sites means able trust everywhere else radiosondes reported aggregate warming trend degrees celsius fahrenheit per decade since spots globe satellites also recorded warming trend degrees celsius fahrenheit per decade globally however satellite data show cooling trend degrees celsius per decade since first noaa tiros satellites went service radiosonde launch sites distributed evenly around planet christy said representative total globe radiosonde balloons released stations around world usually
