mon sep adam beberg wrote battery pack huh dont use batteries mile run use capacitors many times actually use energy density get energy fast enough note even best supercapacitors long way go reasonably good electrochemical energy sources recharge discharge quickly take lots cycles best battery ideal absorbing braking energy turn smoking tires moments minutes afterwards battery packs fully swapped recharging run anyway like gas dragster refueled wouldnt cheating mph problem see reason evs dominate dragster runs traction limiting factor motor power basically put motors wheelhubs mounted composite frame dump juice melt sec downstream plenty time smoke anything course roar spew smokage t_happen
