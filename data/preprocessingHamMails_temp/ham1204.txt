text recognition algorithm architecture humans use anything like algorithm structure ve_been working reason first letter lesser extent last letter important without text pattern recognition problem exponentially difficult theoretical standpoint anyway resolved using deeper abstraction analysis middle letters far less important computationally much easier resolve correctly think keeping number middle letters consistent correct spelling important would interesting see effect applicable written forms languages maybe even japanese romongi bill
