billg oversees product strategy two things road map one piece paper tells everyone records bunch bottom plans something impose broadly vision top going try get everything shared path getting everything stopped time trying take top four five things trying longhorn wave yukon wave net wave really enough time cross cutting discussions make happen bill gates dedicated full time chief software architect also happens chairman company spends time chief software architect body meets every month sltt senior leadership technical team basically top people involved product creating strategy present discuss issues bill driving process waves instance ask cross cutting scenarios want get right product groups together bring things front sltt people talk takes good manager people talk good

sltt process scenarios perspective profit loss structure multiple businesses given work giving people framework gets make whole bigger sum parts mean better offerings ballmer charge july pm pt one knows better microsoft ceo steve ballmer net platform evolves success microsoft depends well company coordinates tool server client strategies well communicates vision interview infoworld test center director steve gillmor infoworld editor large ed scannell microsoft fusion ballmer discussed progress net changes company approach product development microsoft efforts simplify product licensing inspire trust customers partners last time talked two years ago beginning net era net evolution let start talking think xml revolution first talk net believe industry collectively decided last three four years world going replatformed xml key foundation like anyone ever got together decide like magnetic north clearly indicated everyone rallying around concept think degree xml pervasive might still underestimated lot partners even conference see big companies really way software general designed way security work management everything changed answer direct question two years ago might said jury still whether xml going happen questioning going legitimate competitor java world decided embrace xml basis next generation technology lot benefits come could something xml sure could specific technical implementation merely fact comes internet standards deeper semantic abilities interoperability connection context net say couple things would say momentum market customers using net product line like merrill lynch credit suisse marks spencer citibank variety others people things real feel like degree front ways smaller ways larger smaller sense everyone talking xml talk even sun bigger execution sense ve_delivered delivered first batch products really built xml core visual studio net biztalk server getting traction feel good execution relative everyone else say people reasonable bolt xml support stuff heavy lifting convince customers partners follow along set standard adoption upgrading next generation present picture behaving consistently within framework focusing customer issues customer satisfaction trustworthy computing articulated things would done differently hindsight would increased focus security deployment lot security problems actually deployment problems fix sometimes get tools hands deploy fixes fast enough licensing know would given time better ways plan around kinds changes made still going get smart full ramifications expect changes made july licensing lot push back nothing happen july continue learn time need earn customers trust earn business think many people pushing back really even know new terms fault educating yes fault meet plenty customers whose companies already licenses saying think problem deny problems sure issues work time july going see real issues talking customer show saying thought would problem told completed deal company universally licensed total costs company lower said oh really go july lot customers signed licenses sure going find issues bigger concerns today probably larger accounts may issues need address among smaller size companies net initiative change way house client server developers work together trying health net health company sanity people work quality products produce orchestrated ber road map going two things road map one piece paper tells everyone records bunch bottom plans something impose broadly vision top going try get everything shared path getting everything stopped

scenarios perspective profit loss structure multiple businesses given work giving people framework gets make whole bigger sum parts mean better offerings seems scenarios construct really working evolution solutions approach would say pretty direct extrapolation solutions stuff think getting little experience think use word scenarios often solutions less solution sounds like fixed thing end day things customizable programmable people make solution want still scenarios software deployment look like well scenario involves windows office applications working hard make sure whole bigger sum parts say people always comfortable even say perfectly lot better think would big step forward customers approach cut technology civil wars microsoft past involving going gain control project seems democratic approach development would use word democracy describe people come together ultimately make decisions voting process agenda think important get lot input decided people get vote feet try make quantum leap terms ability improve pulling together pieces customers want us simplifying concepts unifying customers say want us go ahhh get makes sense want go six meetings people say workflow strategy biztalk office workflow strategy synchronization ways better mail outlook file folders web pages get sort synchronization sometimes get high level road map work build something today talking unifying storage best way get stuff work get work one way keep tuning one set parameters instead thousand flowers blooming fusion keynote today talked competitors usual suspects one mention competing last generation technology always given stuff wear break question whether breaks ballmer grins break like machinery get anyone something new something interesting innovative people think ok upgrades try sell new product decided users like us level systems integration get involved take sharepoint team services put office could sold team services separate product could introduced new sku stock keeping unit could decided work level old office new version office could real time communications tend like put things together integrate release batches upgrades form introducing new innovation matter stuff wear convince people idea better powerful older idea two aspects one aspect given product upgrade release make sense convince nyear period time enough innovation want licensed innovation part whole licensing discussion moved new licensing two reasons would say wanted simplify licensing look back year guarantee simpler nothing simpler transition learning new familiar old think people eventually realize simpler licensing got pretty complicated years people came understand issue timing delivering innovation want lot rough questions customers new ideas like ok put upgrade one stream stuff best customers access terms contract think long run better chance satisfying latter hitting six different upgrades fan letting customer decide ok want piece piece licensed two things sought gets back trust issue front load the_big lumpy upgrade back load vision net servers long gap middle sell untrusting audience truth need better things big lumpy like new file system like sort small user feature change file system storage backup probaby things going change probably shell ought change applications lot things going change call lumpy put four new features powerpoint sure would look lumpy users think build trust model going deliver time come overnight people see things innovation lumpy comes evenly steadily people develop confidence faith like aspects model time support needs become intimately involved story know know exactly means yet whole notion software service licensing business discussion software get rearchitected world internet mean many software products fundamentally different internet many probably anti virus guys keep best always feeding new virus support asked audience fusion many use windows update small piece software big consumer market ve_got get really purr corporate market lack broadband build adoption seems holding ability users take advantage new services talking bill gates invested comcast cable triggered baby bells get board dsl deal issue thing make software compelling people start saying well course going get broadband one compelling features yes hotel sun valley utah week wired turned pc xp tells wireless network available connect something called mountaineer well know vpn microsoft worked know whose broadband used see bill room called said hey come room soon everyone connecting internet room support modalities whether gprs general packet radio service make easy provision software perspective things go dsl cable modems software want broadband link many things say really care performance downloading powerpoint files want broadband things speed otherwise without speed going put lot pressure broadband community weird answer normal answer yeah awful enough broadband prices charge agree look happened japan recently big drop month dsl vroom gone almost dsl connections year ago million million subscribers make happen country think beyond us enough interest consumers looking intensely broadband whether today prices tomorrow prices going shake marketplace think marketplace good job make something obvious consumers want happen live neigborhood broadband network dsl cable modems well neighbor teledesic chairman co ceo craig mccaw wireless network think piggyback ballmer laughs yes broadband bottleneck also think look oursleves software industry say bottleneck built software makes broadband must microsoft ceo weighs ballmer addresses number key issues customers partners security trust things would done differently coordinating product groups working hard make sure whole bigger sum parts product licensing
