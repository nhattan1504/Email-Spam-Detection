money bank make fat risk subpoena securities exchange commission hard may believe days infectious greed sabers unsheathed scientists discovered small brave act cooperating another person choosing trust cynicism generosity selfishness makes brain light quiet joy studying neural activity young women playing classic laboratory game called prisoner dilemma participants select number greedy cooperative strategies pursue financial gain researchers found women chose mutualism ism mental circuitry normally associated reward seeking behavior swelled life longer women engaged cooperative strategy strongly flowed blood pathways pleasure researchers performing work emory university atlanta used magnetic resonance imaging take might called portraits brain hugs results really surprising us said dr gregory berns psychiatrist author new report appears current issue journal neuron went expecting opposite researchers thought biggest response would occur cases one person cooperated

findings researchers studied women years old many students emory inspired participate promise monetary rewards scientists chose female sample brain imaging studies looked women limited men mixture men women vast body non imaging data rely using prisoner dilemma simple elegant model reciprocity said dr james rilling author neuron paper princeton referred the_e coli social psychology past results researchers said one assume neuro imaging studies men playing game would similar new findings women basic structure trial two women meet briefly ahead time one placed scanner remained outside scanning room two interacted computer playing rounds game every round player pressed button indicate whether would cooperate defect answer would shown screen player monetary awards apportioned round one player defected cooperated defector earned cooperator nothing chose cooperate earned opted defect earned hence mutual cooperation start finish far profitable strategy woman complete mutual defection gave risk woman took time became greedy little bit cooperative strategy would fall apart would emerge poorer cases women allowed pursue strategy chose cases non scanned woman would confederate researchers instructed unbeknown scanned subject defect three consecutive rounds cooperation better keep things less rarefied pretty lifelike gritty still experiments woman scanner played computer knew partner machine tests women played computer thought human researchers found rule freely strategizing women cooperated even occasional episodes defection whether free strategizers confederates necessarily fatal alliance social bond could reattained easily defector chose cooperate next couple rounds another author report dr clinton kilts said although the_one originally betrayed might wary result episodic defections average per experiment take participants pairs though got locked mutual defection dr rilling said analyzing scans researchers found rounds cooperation two broad areas brain activated rich neurons able respond dopamine brain chemical famed role addictive behaviors one anteroventral striatum middle brain right spinal cord experiments rats shown electrodes placed striatum animals repeatedly press bar stimulate electrodes apparently receiving pleasurable feedback starve death rather stop pressing bar another region activated cooperation orbitofrontal cortex region right eyes addition part reward processing system dr rilling said also involved impulse control every round confronted possibility getting extra dollar defecting said choice cooperate requires impulse control significantly reward circuitry women considerably less responsive knew playing computer thought human bond mere monetary gain source contentment display concert imaging results women asked afterward summaries felt the_games often described feeling good cooperated expressed positive feelings camaraderie toward playing partners assuming urge cooperate extent innate among humans reinforced
